# NYBG Forest Project
 In this project I learnt to use Illustrator and ai2html workflow.
 In addition I got to deepen my skills in HTML and CSS, as well as data cleaning and visualization with Jupyter Notebook, Python, R and ggplot.
 The end result is a responsive web page with a journalistic article and data visualizations: https://lauramiina.github.io/nybg-forest/
